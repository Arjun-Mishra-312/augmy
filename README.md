## Inspiration
Have ever been in a situation where you have got to visualize a 3D figure by just looking at it in your book in 2D? Well, we plan to improve that experience by providing you an app that helps you visualize 2D pictures from your book in 3D, and provide youtube videos related to that topic for your better understatement.

## What it does
The app takes an image file as an input and then extracts certain keywords using text recognition by google-ml-kit. After that, the app runs a search query and finds youtube videos and 3D models(using echo-ar) related to the selected keywords. In the end, the user can view the youtube videos and analyze the 3D models
## How we built it
The entire app was made using Flutter, with the help of EchoAR.

The UI was designed using Figma.
## Challenges we ran into
* Implementation of text recognition using Google ML Kit.
* Working with APIs
* Implementation of Glassmorphism and Radial Blur to improve the UI/UX of the app.

## What's next for AugMy
* Using machine learning, we aim to form questions regarding the selected keywords.
* With the help of advanced algorithms, we plan to extract better and more keywords and provide better results.
* Planned on adding more and better 3D models to the app.
* Finally a filter to search the model by the following categories
    * New
    * Rising
    * Subject
